# Repository Overview - API with Python using FastAPI

This repository contains an example template of an API built with Python using **FastAPI**. Below, we detail the main dependencies and technologies used, as well as setup instructions with **Poetry**, database version control with **Alembic**, type-safe data handling with **Pydantic**, and application containerization with **Docker**.

## Dependencies and Package Management with Poetry

To facilitate dependency and version management, we use **Poetry**. It allows us to easily manage the libraries used in the application, ensuring compatible versions and security in the development environment.

### Poetry Installation

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

### Install Dependencies

After configuring Poetry, the project dependencies can be installed with the command:

```bash
poetry install
```

## API with FastAPI

**FastAPI** is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework, easy to use, and particularly suited for building RESTful APIs. It uses Python type hints for automatic data validation and generates automatic documentation, such as **Swagger UI**.

### Benefits of FastAPI

- Easy to use and intuitive;
- Automatic validation based on Python type annotations;
- Asynchronous support with asyncio;
- Automatic documentation generation via **OpenAPI** (Swagger).

### Installation with Poetry

To install FastAPI, run the command:

```bash
poetry add fastapi
poetry add uvicorn[standard]  # Server to run the application
```

### Running the FastAPI Application

To start the FastAPI server with Uvicorn:

```bash
poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload
```

API documentation will be available at: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`

## Alembic for Database Versioning

**Alembic** is a tool for database version control. It allows you to create and apply migrations in a safe and organized way.

### Installation with Poetry

To install Alembic:

```bash
poetry add alembic
```

### Configure Alembic

To initialize Alembic in the project:

```bash
poetry run alembic init migrations
```

### Create a Migration

```bash
poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "migration_description"
```

### Apply a Migration

```bash
poetry run alembic upgrade head
```

## Pydantic for Structured Typing

**Pydantic** is used to ensure strong typing and data validation by creating **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)** and **response models**.

### Benefits of Pydantic

- Guarantee of data validation and typing;
- Clear structuring of objects for input and output data;
- Easy integration with FastAPI.

### Installation with Poetry

To install Pydantic:

```bash
poetry add pydantic
```

Example of usage with DTOs in FastAPI:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
```

## SQLAlchemy for Database Management

**SQLAlchemy** is a library that provides an ORM layer for interacting with databases using Python objects. It is often used together with **Pydantic** for data mapping between the database and the application.

### Installation with Poetry

To install SQLAlchemy:

```bash
poetry add sqlalchemy
```

### Basic Usage Example:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

Base = declarative_base()

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, index=True)
    email = Column(String, unique=True, index=True)

# Configure the engine and session
DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./test.db"
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)

Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
```

## Containers and Docker

The application is containerized using **Docker** to ensure that the environment is replicable and portable. We use a **Dockerfile** to build the application image and a **docker-compose.yaml** to configure and run the full environment.

### Dockerfile

The Dockerfile describes how the Docker image is built:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock /app/
RUN pip install poetry && poetry install --no-root

COPY . /app

CMD ["poetry", "run", "uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

### docker-compose.yaml

The `docker-compose.yaml` file makes it easy to run multiple services in containers, such as the database and the FastAPI application:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./test.db

  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: app_db
```

### Basic Docker Commands

- To build and run the containers:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

- To stop the containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```
